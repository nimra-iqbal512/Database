== Topic: Constraint, Primary key, Foreign key

The following are the commonly used constraints used in SQL.

-- 1) NOT NULL
Ensures that a column cannot have a NULL value.
- Syntax:
CREATE TABLE Persons(
  ID int NOT NULL,
  LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  FirstName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  Age int
);


-- 2) UNIQUE
Ensures that all values in a column are different. But it can also accept NULL values.


-- UNIQUE vs PRIMARY KEY:
In a table, there can be several 'UNIQUE' constraints, but only one 'PRIMARY KEY' constraint.
Both ensures uniqueness, but 'UNIQUE' constraint may accepts NULL values while 'PRIMARY KEY' nnt allow NULL values.


-- 3) PRIMARY KEY
A combination of a NOT NULL and UNIQUE. Uniquely identifies each row in a table.
Each table has only one Primary Key. The value of Primary key can't be NULL. The system will not allow inserting a row with a primary key which already exists in the table.

- Composite Primary Key:
The primary key can be a combination of multiple columns. This combination is known as Composite Primary Key.
The Primary key can have a maximum of 16 columns.


-- 4) FOREIGN KEY
It prevents actions that would destroy links between tables.
A FOREIGN KEY is a field (or collection of fields) in one table, that refers to the PRIMARY KEY in another table.
The table with the foreign key is called the child table, and the table being referenced (tabe with the primary key against foreign key) is called referenced or parent table.
Foreign Key must refers to the Primary Key in some other table, or it may be NULL.    

- Referential Integrity: ??? 
The foreign key in child table references the primary key in the parent table.
This parent-child relationship enforces the rule which is known as "Referential Integrity."
Referential integrity is a property of data stating that all its references are valid. In the context of relational databases, it requires that if a value of one attribute (column) of a relation (table) references a value of another attribute (either in the same or a different relation), then the referenced value must exist.    
(Need to explore in more detail may be).          


-- 5) CHECK
It is used to limit the value range that can be placed in a column. It ensures that the values in a column satisfies a specific condition.


-- 6) DEFAULT
Sets a default value for a column if no value is specified.

== Question:
-- If Primary key is composite key, then can any one them can be NULL?
- No in a composite key, not any of the key be NULL.
CREATE TABLE Course_Enrollment (
    student_id INT,
    course_id INT,
    enrollment_date DATE,
    PRIMARY KEY (student_id, course_id) -- Composite Primary Key
);

INSERT INTO Course_Enrollment
VALUES (NULL, 110, '2024-09-01');  --ERROR! Column 'student_id' cannot be null
