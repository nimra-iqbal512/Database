-- If view is a virtual table, then why changes are also made in original/base table?
-- Although a view is a virtual table (meaning it doesn't store data itself), it acts as a window to the data in the underlying base table(s). When you perform operations like INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE on a view, those changes are actually passed through to the base table(s) because the view is just a representation of that data.
-- DML operations on simple views are redirected to the base table.
-- When you run:
    -- UPDATE DetailsView
    -- SET ADDRESS = 'Lahore'
    -- WHERE NAME = 'Ashmal';
-- Itâ€™s equivalent to:
    -- UPDATE StudentDetails
    -- SET ADDRESS = 'Lahore'
    -- WHERE NAME = 'Ashmal';


-- Update a view (change view definition without affecting data)
