== SQL vs MySQL
- MySQL is an open-source relational database management system we can interact with using Structured Query Language (SQL).
- SQL is a language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. While SQL is a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) that uses SQL.
- SQL is a standard language (like English) for databases. MySQL is a software application (like Microsoft Word for documents).

== SQL Commands: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sql-ddl-dql-dml-dcl-tcl-commands/
SQL Commands are like instructions. These are used to interact with database and perform operations.
SQL commands can perform various tasks like creating a table, adding data to tables, dropping the table, modifying the table, set permission for users.

-- SQL Commands are mainly categorized into five categories.
DDL - Data Definition Language
DQL - Data Query Language
DML - Data Manipulation Language
DCL - Data Control Language
TCL - Transaction Control Language

-- 1) 
Data Definition Language(DDL): 
DDL consists of commands that can be  used for defining(creating), altering, deleting database structures such as tables, indexes, and schemas.
It also defines indexes(keys), specify links between tables, and impose constraints between tables.

Common DDL Commands:

- CREATE(CREATE DATABASE, CREATE TABLE, CREATE INDEX)
It creates database or its objects(table, index, function, views, store procedures, and triggers).
- Syntax:
CREATE TABLE table_name(
  column1 data_type,
  column2 data_type,
  ...
);

- DROP(DROP TABLE, DROP INDEX)
Delete objects from the database.
- Syntax:
DROP TABLE table_name;

- ALTER(ALTER DATABASE, ALTER TABLE)
Alter the structure of databse.
- Syntax:
ALTER TABLE table_name 
ADD COLUMN column_name data_type;

- TRUNCATE
Remove all records from a table, including all spaces allocated for the records are removed.
- Syntax:
TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;

- COMMENT
Add comments to the data dictionary
- Syntax:
COMMENT 'comment_text' ON TABLE table_name;

- RENAME
Rename an object existing in the database.
- Syntax:
RENAME TABLE old_table_name TO new_table__name;


-- 2)
Data Query Language(DQL): 
SELECT is the DQL command. 
DQL statements are used for performing queries on the data within schema objects. When a SELECT is fired against a table or tables, the result is compiled into a further temporary table, which is displayed or perhaps received by the program.

- SELECT
It is uaed to retrieve data from the database.
- Syntax:
SELECT column1, column2, ... 
FROM table_name 
WHERE condition;


-- 3)
Data Manipulation Language(DML):
These SQL commands deal with the manipulation of data present in the database. It includes most of the SQL statements.
(It is the component of SQL statement that controls access to data and to the database. Basically, DCL statements are grouped with DML statemnets.(Not know about it in detail))

Common DML Commands:

- INSERT
Insert data into a table
- Synatx:
INSERT INTO table_name(column1, column2, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, ...);

- UPDATE
Update existing data within a table
- Synatx:
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2
WHERE condition;

- DELETE
Delete records from a database table
- Synatx:
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

- LOCK
Table control concurrency
- Synatx:
LOCK TABLE table_name
IN lock_mode;

- CALL
Call a PL/SQL or Java subprogram
- Synatx:
CALL procedure_name(arguments);

- EXPLAIN PLAN
Describe the access path to data
- Synatx:
EXPLAIN PLAN FOR SELECT * FROM table_name;


-- 4):
Data Control Language(DCL):
DCL includes commands such as GRANT and REVOKE which mainly deals with the 
rights, permissions, and other controls of the database system.
These commands are used to control access to data  in the database by granting  or revoking permissions.

Common DCL Commands:

- GRANT
Assigns new privileges to a user account, allowing access to specific database objects, actions, or functions.

- REVOKE
Removes previously granted privileges from a user account, taking away their access to certain database objects or actions.


-- 5):
Transaction Control Language(TCL):
SQL commands that help to manage transactions that take place in a database.
Transactions group a set of tasks into a single execution unit. Each transaction begins with a single task, and ends when all the tasks in a group are successfully completed. If any of the tasks fail, the transaction fails. Therefore, a transaction has only two results: success or failure.

Common TCL Commands:

- UPDATE TRANSACTION
Starts a new transaction

- COMMIT:
Saves all changes made during the transaction

- ROLLBACK:
Undoes all changes made during the transaction

- SAVEPOINT: 
Creates a savepoint within the current transaction


=============================================
== ALTER VS UPDATE

= ALTER
- ALTER SQL command is a DDL(Data Definition Language) statement.
- It is used to update the structure of table in the database (like add, delete, modify the attributes of the table in the database).
- Syntax:
ALTER TABLE table_name
DROP COLUMN column_name

= UPDATE
- UPDATE SQL command is a DML(Data Manipulation Language) statement.
- It is used to manipulate the data of any existing column. But don't change the table's definition.
- Syntax:
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, .., column = valueN
WHERE condition;


=============================================
== DELETE VS TRUNCATE VS DROP

= DELETE:
removes specific rows from a table based on a WHERE condition.
- Syntax:
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
DELETE FROM table_name; (Not using WHERE will remove all records from the table just like TRUNCATE)

== TRUNCATE:
Quickly removes all rows from a table. (faster than DELETE).
- Syntax:
TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;

== DROP:
Deletes an entire table along with its structure(schema). It also removes any dependencies like indexes and constraints.
- Syntax:
DROP TABLE table_name;
